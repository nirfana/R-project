# R-project
:v: Welcome to my R-projects repository! <br> 
Here, I will be storing my data analyst portfolio using the R programming language.

Each project will have its own folder, and the data for each project will be stored in a separate folder named `Data`. 

The rest of the files for each project, such as .R scripts and .Rmd files, will be stored in their own folders. This will make it easy to manage my projects and keep them organized.

> :bulb: Note: The data sets used in this project were obtained from open-source websites like Kaggle, primarily for educational purposes.
